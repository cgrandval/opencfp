    <h2 class="headline--beta">Call for Papers Talk Ideas</h2>
    <p>
        {{ site.title }} is an event about software factory and security in PHP developments.
        So it's not limited to just PHP-related talks. There have been
        sessions covering a wide range of topics supporting PHP developers and DevOps
        as well, and we encourage you to "think outside the box" to come up with your own unique topics.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>It is advisable to submit a few talk ideas, not just one.</strong>
        By submitting a single talk you may lessen your chances of being selected.
    </p>
    <p>
        To get the ideas flowing, here's a few suggestions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Development best practices</li>
        <li>Web / PHP Security</li>
        <li>Design patterns</li>
        <li>Security best practices</li>
        <li>Security tools</li>
        <li>Testing (unit, functional, etc.)</li>
